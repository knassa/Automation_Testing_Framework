# Automation_Testing_Framework
This is a demo project on how to create a Maven based Automation_Testing_Framework in which data can be read from excel file, config file and also user can provide which browser to initialize. Also we have used webdriver manager and if required in future user can change the version of any dependency int he POM.xml.  Happy Learning!!
